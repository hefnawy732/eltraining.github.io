        <p><strong>Step 1: Greeting the Customer</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Smiles Market:</strong> “Welcome to Smiles Market.”</li>
            <li><strong>ShopperApp_MarketPlace:</strong> “Welcome to elGrocer by Smiles.”</li>
            <li><strong>Smiles_MarketPlace:</strong> “Welcome to Smiles Groceries.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reassure the customer with one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“I am checking the order right now, I appreciate your patience.”</li>
            <li>“Kindly allow me a few minutes to check for you.”</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2: Verifying the Order Details</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access the Order Details:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Navigate to: DB > Orders > Order Details > Order Positions</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Check if the Missing Item is Marked as Out of Stock (OOS):</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If marked OOS:</strong> Ensure the customer was not charged for it by comparing the billed amount with the amount captured from the customer.</li>
                <li><strong>If not marked OOS:</strong> Review the receipt image: DB > Orders > Order Details > Receipt Image > Click here to view image.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Resolving Missing Items</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Item Not on the Bill:</strong></li>

                        <li>If the item was not billed, inform the customer that the amount for the item was not captured, and only the amount for the received items was charged.</li>

                        <li>Verify with the store via WhatsApp or call.</li>
                        <li>Consult the Dispatch team on Slack to locate the item.</li>
                        <li>If the item was missed by the picker:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Submit a Jotform for the missing item: <a href="[Jotform Link]" target="_blank">Jotform Link</a></li>
                                <li>Arrange a driver to deliver the item based on the customer’s availability.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Determine the Escalation Path Based on the Store Type:

        <p><strong>Step 1: Greeting the Customer</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin by offering a warm, market-specific greeting:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Smiles Market:</strong> “Welcome to Smiles Market.”</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ask the customer to provide two photos:
                <ul>
                    <li>A photo of the item they received.</li>
                    <li>A photo of the barcode on the item.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2: Verifying the Item Details</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access the Database:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Compare the barcode, photo, description, price, and size of the item the customer received with the item they ordered.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>This indicates the customer received a completely different item.</li>
                <li>Notify the catalogue team to update the item information.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>If the Barcode and Description Match:</strong></li>

                <li>This suggests that the picker selected the wrong item.</li>
                <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the customer updated throughout the process.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>If the Item's Value is Less Than 20 AED (Marketplace Stores):</strong></li>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Non-Dedicated Store:</strong> The store is responsible for delivery/picking.</li>
                <li><strong>Partial Dedicated:</strong> Our delivery team handles delivery, but the store is responsible for picking.</li>
                <li>You can directly refund the customer by raising a refund request.</li>

            <li><strong>If the Item's Value is Less Than 15 AED (Dark Stores):</strong></li>

    'Late Delivery': `
       <div class="headline">Handling Late Delivery: Addressing Customer Concerns</div>

<p>When addressing customer inquiries about the status of their order, such as "Where’s my order?" "I can’t track my order," or "I didn’t receive my order," follow this structured approach:</p>

<p><strong>1. Greeting the Customer</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Smiles Market:</strong> “Welcome to Smiles Market.”</li>
    <li><strong>ShopperApp_MarketPlace:</strong> “Welcome to elGrocer by Smiles.”</li>
    <li><strong>Smiles_MarketPlace:</strong> “Welcome to Smiles Groceries.”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Identifying the Store Type and Delivery Method</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Determine the Store Type and Responsibility:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dedicated Store:</strong> Our delivery/picker is responsible.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Dedicated Store:</strong> The store handles delivery/picking.</li>
            <li><strong>Partial Dedicated:</strong> Our delivery team handles delivery; the store handles picking.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark Store:</strong> Orders are processed through a specialized store.</li>
            <li><strong>Smiles Fleet:</strong> Delivery is handled by our fleet.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Checking the Order Status</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use the Appropriate Tool:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dedicated or Partial Dedicated Store:</strong> Check MP Locus Dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Dark Store:</strong> Check DarkStore Locus Dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Smiles Fleet:</strong> Check DB &gt; Analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Store’s Delivery:</strong> Contact the store directly via WhatsApp or phone call.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the customer informed throughout this process to avoid communication gaps.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Evaluating the Delivery Slot</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Check Delivery Slot Status:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to Dashboard &gt; Orders &gt; Delivery Slot to determine if the order is late or still within the expected timeframe.</li>
            <li><strong>If Within the Delivery Slot:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apologize for any perceived delay and thank the customer for their patience.</li>
                    <li>Provide an updated estimated time of arrival (ETA) and confirm the order is still within the delivery slot. Provide the driver’s details if available.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Handling Late Orders (Exceeding the Delivery Slot)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>For Dedicated or Partial Dedicated Stores:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Contact the Dispatch team via Slack to understand the reason for the delay.</li>
            <li>Apologize to the customer and provide the updated ETA from Locus.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>For Dark Stores:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Report the issue to the DarkStore Dispatch team via Slack.</li>
            <li>Apologize and update the customer with the new ETA from Locus.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the delay is due to factors that cannot be resolved immediately (e.g., vehicle problems, weather conditions, or the order not being ready), consider rescheduling the delivery with the customer instead of canceling the order.</p>

<p>This approach ensures effective communication and resolution of late delivery issues.</p>
